# Lunar-landing-in-machine-learning
Reinforcement learning research on simulating the environment of robots landing on moon and explored ways of landing.
•	Compared the performance of Q-Learning, SARSA and Expected SARSA with SoftMax Policy and its application in tile coding and neural network in different surface environment of landing on moon.
•	Compared performance of vanilla stochastic gradient descent, AdaGrad, RMSProp, and ADAM optimizer in training the neural network.
•	Ran experiment to determine the parameters of expected SARSA---temperature parameter and step-size parameter.
